  # If you need to access services in a test, create an alias
  # and then fetch that alias from the container. As a convention,
  # aliases are prefixed with test. For example:
  # test.App\Service\MyService: '@App\Service\MyService'
  test.App\Service\EnclosureBuilderService: '@App\Service\EnclosureBuilderService'
  #    alias: 'App\Service\EnclosureBuilderService'
  #    public: true
  #'@App\Service\EnclosureBuilderService'
